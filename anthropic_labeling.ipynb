      "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the problem is about the polynomial P(x) which is given as the product from (x-1)^1 up to (x-10)^10. When we remove the roots from the number line, we get 11 disjoint open intervals. We need to find on how many of these intervals the polynomial is positive.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I remember that the sign of a polynomial between its roots depends on the multiplicity of the roots and the leading coefficient. Since all the factors here are of the form (x - k)^n where n is the exponent, the multiplicity of each root k is n. But since we're looking at open intervals between the roots, which are the points 1, 2, 3, ..., 10. So between each consecutive pair of these roots (like between 1 and 2, 2 and 3, etc.), the polynomial's sign could change or stay the same depending on the multiplicities.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, actually, the number of times the sign changes when passing through a root depends on whether the multiplicity is even or odd. If a root has an even multiplicity, the graph touches the x-axis but doesn't cross it, so the sign doesn't change. If it's odd, the sign does change. So for each root k, if the exponent is even, the sign remains the same when passing through k; if it's odd, the sign flips.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the key here is to track how the sign of P(x) changes as we move from left to right across the number line, passing through each root from 1 to 10. Each time we cross a root with an odd multiplicity, the sign flips. If the multiplicity is even, the sign stays the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's note the multiplicities: for each root k (from 1 to 10), the multiplicity is k itself. So root 1 has multiplicity 1 (odd), root 2 has multiplicity 2 (even), root 3 has multiplicity 3 (odd), and so on up to root 10 with multiplicity 10 (even).\n",

      "So the multiplicities alternate between odd and even. Wait, actually, let's list them:\n",

      "So, each odd-numbered root (1,3,5,7,9) has odd multiplicity, and even-numbered roots (2,4,6,8,10) have even multiplicity. Therefore, when crossing an odd-numbered root, the sign of P(x) will flip. When crossing an even-numbered root, the sign remains the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, we need to determine the sign of P(x) in each of the intervals between the roots. Let's start from the far left, to the left of x=1. For x approaching negative infinity, what is the sign of P(x)?\n",
      "\n",
      "The leading term of P(x) is when we multiply all the highest powers of x. Each term (x - k)^k contributes x^k. So the leading term is x^(1+2+3+...+10). The sum from 1 to 10 is (10*11)/2 = 55. So the leading term is x^55. The coefficient is positive (since all coefficients in each (x -k) term are 1). So as x approaches negative infinity, x^55 (which is an odd degree) would be negative. Therefore, to the left of x=1, the polynomial is negative.\n",
      "\n",
